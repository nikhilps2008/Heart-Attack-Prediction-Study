# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Study

# Problem Statement:
Understanding the complex interplay of various factors contributing to heart attack risks is crucial for developing preventive measures. This project seeks to identify and visualize key influencers of heart attack risks, with a special focus on diabetes, by analyzing a diverse dataset. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help in risk assessment and management.

# Tools Used:
Power BI

Power Query Editor

# Key Features:
Heart Attack Risk by Age: Visualization of how heart attack risk varies across different age groups, with the maximum age in the study being 90.
Diabetes and Heart Attack Risk: Analysis shows that 65.23% of individuals with heart attacks have diabetes (represented as 1: Yes) compared to 34.77% without diabetes (0: No).
Heart Attack Risk by Country and Continent: Geographic distribution of heart attack risks, with the highest risks in Asia (2.5K) and Europe (2.2K), and the lowest in Africa, Australia, and North America (0.9K each).
Income by Heart Attack Risk: Insights into how income levels influence heart attack risks, with 63.94% in lower-income groups and 36.06% in higher-income groups.
Stress Level and Heart Attack Risk: Average stress level for those at risk is 5.47 on a scale of 1 to 10.
Exercise Hours by Heart Attack Risk: A noticeable inverse relationship, with heart attack risk decreasing as exercise hours per week increase, ranging from 56K to 32K.
Key Influencers: Identification of key factors that increase heart attack risks:
Smoking (1: Yes) increases risk by 0.18.
Diabetes (1: Yes) increases risk by 0.11.
Alcohol consumption (1: Yes) increases risk by 0.07.

# Outcome:
This project provides an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore various factors influencing heart attack risks. By offering detailed visualizations and key insights, the study aids in understanding and mitigating heart attack risks, particularly for individuals with diabetes. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and informative, making it a valuable tool for both healthcare professionals and the general public.
