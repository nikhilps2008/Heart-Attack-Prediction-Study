# Heart Attack Prediction Study

## Project Scope
This project focuses on understanding and visualizing the factors contributing to heart attack risks, with a particular emphasis on diabetes. By analyzing a diverse dataset, the project aims to identify key influencers of heart attack risks and provide actionable insights for risk assessment and management.

## Context or Background Info
Heart attacks are influenced by a complex interplay of various factors, including age, diabetes, geographic location, income, stress, and exercise levels. Identifying these factors and understanding their impact is crucial for developing effective preventive measures. This project utilizes data analysis to highlight significant trends and relationships that can aid in risk management.

## Visualizations
The project includes interactive dashboards that provide visual insights into the following aspects:
- **Heart Attack Risk by Age:** Visualizes how heart attack risk varies across different age groups.
- **Diabetes and Heart Attack Risk:** Displays the proportion of individuals with heart attacks who have diabetes.
- **Heart Attack Risk by Country and Continent:** Shows the geographic distribution of heart attack risks.
- **Income by Heart Attack Risk:** Illustrates the relationship between income levels and heart attack risks.
- **Stress Level and Heart Attack Risk:** Displays average stress levels for those at risk.
- **Exercise Hours by Heart Attack Risk:** Highlights the inverse relationship between exercise hours and heart attack risk.
